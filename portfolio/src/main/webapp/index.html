      <h2>A summary of my story</h2>
      <p style="font-size:130%;">I am originally from Cameroon, which is in Central Africa. I speak 
          French as a first language and I emigrated to the United States four years ago with the dream to become an engineer. 
          I was completely overwhelmed at first because I spoke almost no English. It wasn't straightforward 
          for me to understand and talk to people.
          However, in the Summer of 2015, I started with English as a second language (ESL) at 
          Waubonsee Community College.
          I completed the program one year later, and I graduated with my Associate Degree in computer science in May 2019. Now I am a junior student studying computer science at 
          the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. I ended up choosing computer science because of my passion for technology and the desire 
          I have to solve complex problems. In 2015, I was nominated to emigrate to the United States and continue my education; my mother, however, was hesitant. At first, she did not want me to go. 
          She thought it would be hard to succeed in another country where another language was spoken. I reminded her of all she and my father taught me, and I convinced her I could succeed. 
          I ended up coming to the United States where I continue to work hard to pursue my dream of becoming a software engineer.</p>
